\section{Making \LaTeX{} Math Audibly Legible}

We are trying something new to make \LaTeX\ more readable. We have some inline math, for example, we know that $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^{2}$. Also \(x + y = z\) and the following:

\begin{equation}
       x_i^2 + y^2 = (z^2 + 1)
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation*}
        \mymat{ 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 }
     \end{equation*} 
\begin{equation}
    x_i^2 + y^2 = (z^2 + 1)
 \end{equation}
Or this one:
    \[
       Z = \frac{x+1}{2}
    \]
