The next example concerns images, which because those are
    created outside of \LaTeXe ~will require content creators to help
    label the image with useful alternative text.  Here is our example.\\[20pt]

    \rule{\textwidth}{1pt}
\begin{lstlisting}
\includegraphic[
    width=2in,
    alt={A cube with exposed faces shown as a gradient of color
    changing from red in the lower left, to yellow lower
    middle, green lower right, cyan upper right,
    blue upper middle, purple upper left, and
    white in the center.}]
